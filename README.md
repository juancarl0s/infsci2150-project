Introduction to Security - Programming Project

**Usage Notes:**
* Always start the receiver before the sender (Server before Client; Bob before Alice; Receiver before Sender)
* For the authentication folder programs, compile them all at once (`javac Protection.java ProtectedServer.java ProtectedClient.java`). If you try to compile them 1 by one they will fail.
